## Sharks & Minnows

This is a simple game inspired by the playground classic sharks and minnows.  The goal is to reach the top of the screen without being eaten by a shark, but whenever any minnow gets eaten they become the shark.
The game was built only using JavaScript for the game logic, CSS for minimal styling, and HTML Canvas to display the game board.
Event handlers were added to allow for button use and movement player movement logic.
Shark movement logic is dictated by an algorithm which finds the shortest distance to surviving minnows, and moves towards it with some randomization included for more interesting gameplay.
